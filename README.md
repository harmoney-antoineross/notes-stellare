- **Integration Testing**: Ensures different components of the `journey` application interact seamlessly.
- **Regression Testing**: Detects any unintended side effects from recent code changes.

**Contribution to Entire Ecosystem:**

By maintaining a robust testing suite, `journey-api-test` guarantees the reliability and stability of journey-related APIs, minimizing downtime and enhancing developer confidence during deployments.

#### **journey-type**

The `journey-type` folder houses TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used across the `journey` applications.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Type Definitions**: Defines consistent data structures and interfaces for journey-related data.
- **Shared Types**: Serves as a centralized location for types used by multiple `journey` sub-applications.
- **Type Safety**: Enhances code reliability by enforcing type checks during development.

**Contribution to Entire Ecosystem:**

`journey-type` promotes consistency and reduces redundancies by providing a single source of truth for type definitions, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.

#### **journey-e2e**

The `journey-e2e` (End-to-End) folder contains comprehensive tests that simulate real user interactions with the journey features.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **User Flow Testing**: Validates complete user journeys, ensuring all components work together as intended.
- **UI Interaction**: Tests frontend interactions with `journey` backend services.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures the responsiveness and reliability of journey workflows under various conditions.

**Contribution to Entire Ecosystem:**

`journey-e2e` ensures that the journey features provide a seamless and error-free experience for end-users, catching integration issues that unit or API tests might miss.

#### **journey-dmn-unit-test**

The `journey-dmn-unit-test` folder focuses on unit tests for the domain models and business logic within the `journey` applications.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Business Logic Validation**: Ensures that core business rules and workflows function correctly.
- **Model Testing**: Validates the integrity and behavior of domain models.
- **Isolation Testing**: Tests individual components in isolation to identify and fix defects early.

**Contribution to Entire Ecosystem:**

By rigorously testing the business logic, `journey-dmn-unit-test` maintains the accuracy and reliability of journey functionalities, supporting robust application behavior.

#### **journey-nfr**

The `journey-nfr` (Non-Functional Requirements) folder addresses aspects such as performance, security, and scalability for the journey features.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Performance Testing**: Assesses the responsiveness and throughput of journey services.
- **Security Audits**: Conducts vulnerability assessments and ensures compliance with security standards.
- **Scalability Testing**: Evaluates how journey applications perform under increased load and concurrent usage.

**Contribution to Entire Ecosystem:**

`journey-nfr` ensures that the journey features meet essential non-functional standards, guaranteeing a secure, efficient, and scalable experience for users.
